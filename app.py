    ### Clean from Tags üßπ
    This option automatically fills in the 'Sector' and 'Category' columns in your file by reading the 'Tags' column.

    1.  **Select Your File**: In the main panel, click the "Browse files" button and select the CSV file you want to clean.
    2.  **Process**: The tool will automatically process the data as soon as you upload the file.
    3.  **Download**: Once it's finished, a "Download Cleaned File" button will appear. Click it to save your updated file. The new file will have `_cleaned` added to its name.

    *Your file **must** contain a `Tags` column. The `Sector` and `Category` columns are optional and will be created if they don't exist.*

    ---

    ### Enrich from Master File ü§ù
    This option uses a correct "master" list of organisations to fill in missing 'Sector' and 'Category' information in a "target" file.

    1.  **Upload Master File**: This is your source of truth. Use the first "Browse files" button to upload your master list of organisations.
        - *This file **must** contain a `Name` (or `Organisation`) column, and the `Sector` and `Category` columns.*
    2.  **Upload Target File**: This is the file you want to fix. Use the second "Browse files" button to upload your target file (e.g., a list of people).
        - *This file **must** contain an `Organisation` column.*
    3.  **Process**: The tool will automatically enrich your target file using the information from the master file.
    4.  **Download**: A "Download Enriched File" button will appear. Click it to save the result. The new file will have `_enriched` added to its name.

        **Troubleshooting Tips:**
        - **"No rows were updated" message:**
            - Check if the `Tags` column in your source file contains values that match the mappings defined in the script.
            - Verify that the `Sector` and `Category` fields you expect to be updated are actually empty. The script is designed not to overwrite existing correct values.
        - **Error during processing:**
            - Ensure your file is a standard CSV format (e.g., saved as "CSV UTF-8" from Excel) and is not corrupted.

        - This should be your clean reference list (e.g., a correct list of organisations).
        - Must contain a column with the organisation's name. The script looks for a column named `Name` first, then falls back to `Organisation`.
        - Must contain the `Sector` and `Category` columns with the correct data you want to copy *from*.

        **2. Target File (The File to Update):**
        - This is the file you want to enrich (e.g., a list of people).
        - Must contain an `Organisation` column. The names in this column will be matched against the Master file.

        **Troubleshooting Tips:**
        - **"No rows were updated" message:**
            - The most common reason is that the organisation names in the **Target File** do not match the names in the **Master File**. The matching is case-insensitive, but spelling, spacing, and punctuation must be identical (e.g., "Stripe" vs. "Stripe, Inc.").
            - Check if the `Sector` and `Category` fields in the target file are already filled. The script only fills in empty values.
        - **Error during processing:**
            - Ensure both uploaded files are valid, uncorrupted CSVs.
